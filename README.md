>Hello! My name is Abhijit and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development 
started back in 2020 when I decided to try editing an e-commerce website — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
Fast-forward to today, and I’ve learned lots of things about Web devolopment and Android devolopments. My main focus these days is building accessible, 
inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.



#Web Devolopment
>I use various web technologies to develop attractive websites which converts visitors to customers. I develop creative and responsive website layouts.

#Android Devolopment
>From design to development to testing and support, we provide end-to-end mobile app development services to help 
you build a new app for Android or port your existing iOS app to Android.

#Product Design
>I work with certain design tools to create high-fidelity designs and prototypes. I design accessible and usable products which aid business growth.

>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
-JavaScript (ES6+) -React -Node.js -WordPress -React Native -php -BootStrap



#Thank You !!
